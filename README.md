### Getting Started
This project is a boilerplate to help you develop your project with Hapi.js and MongoDB.

#### Project Structure
In root, we have the directories: `scripts`, `src`, `test`. 

* **scripts** are responsibles for the bash scripts, like: `bootstrap`, `setup`, `server`, `test` and `update`. You can read more about these scripts in [github/scripts-to-rule-them-all][scripts].
* **src** is the main directory of the source code, all files and directories in that directory are distributed by responsabilites.
    * **core** is where all plugins and important files to the bootstrap of the system. 
    * **shared** here, are the entities shared in the system, like `user`. Common entities in the application need be here, isolated too.
    * **todos** if you have other specific entities, you can create a new directory, `todos` is that case. When a new scope is created you create a new directory for that scope and it will be loaded automatically in the bootstrap application. 
* **test** the tests of applications. we have inside this directory a directory named `routes` where all  exposed routes are tested.

#### Scopes and Entities
Inside the directory `src`you will create a new directory when a new **scope** is requested, like `todos`. Inside that directory, will have an `index.js` in root of the scope directory, and some directories as **entities**.

**Scopes** have **entities** and your application have many scopes. A **scope** are pieces of your application, in a case like a ecommerce, a common scope will be **products**. And in the scope products we'll have **entities** like **product** and **category**.
Inside **entity** we can have new endpoint exported like Hapi plugins in the file `scope/entity/route.js`. You can declare the models and all of your logic in that file. But the recomended is structuring that like **MVC**.

You'll have the files: `model.js`, `routes.js`, `validation.js`, `controller.js`.
* `model.js` will have you model declaration.
* `validation.js` wil have your schema of parameters for every route in your routes.
* `controller.js` will be your controller, a Class that have yours methods for response the router endpoints.
* `routes.js` will be an Hapi.js plugins exported your routes.

Finally, in your `scope/index.js` will get all of your `routes.js` files in your **entities** directories.

### Testing

For testing you just need clone this repo and run `npm test` inside root folder of this project.;
