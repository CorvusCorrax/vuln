[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thebergamo/start-hapiness.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/thebergamo/start-hapiness)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/thebergamo/start-hapiness/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/thebergamo/start-hapiness?branch=master)

## Goal
The main idea for this project is help you to start a new Hapi + MongoDB project. In this case is a simplest boilerplate project using this tools + Promises =D

## Inspirations
When I start this project I look for two main repositories for inspiring me to make this.
[The Agendor's Hapi Sample][4] but this project was depreciated and the [rcorral][5] [project][6] correlated by Agendor.

Thanks very much for this inspirations projects!

## Batteries
- **Hapi** - Web framework
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL Database
- **Bluebird** - Promises and more
- **Lab** - BDD and Code Coverage framework
- **Chai** - Assertion library

## Run this Project
To run this project you need have installed 
- **Node.js** (latest version)
- **MongoDB** 3.0.6

And then just run:
```sh
npm run build && npm start
```

If you want to run tests just run:
```sh
npm test
```

To reply this project for your own new project:
```
npm run duplicate NAME
```
NOTE: All models, routes, validators, controllers, tests and LICENCE will be removed. Only the bootstrap files will be stay. Git project too.

## Run this Project Azk version
Running this project using [azk][0]. Azk will just run this project in a Docker container, by this no one depencies are required, because all dependencies will be installed in the container.

Azk documentation for installing is found [here][1];

To run the project in Azk version:
```sh
azk start 
```

If you want to run tests just run:
```sh
azk shell -c "npm test"
```

NOTE: For duplicating this project you can just run the command above, because if you run in Azk, the project will just copied in container, not in host. No depencies are required for run the duplicate command, just a terminal.
 
### Contribute

implement it. Fork the project, implement the code, make tests, add yourself
to the [contributors][3] list and send the PR to the master branch.

### Testing
